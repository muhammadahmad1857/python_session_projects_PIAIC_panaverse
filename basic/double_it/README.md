Here’s a **README.md** for your "Double the Number" game code:

# Double the Number Game

Welcome to the "Double the Number" game! This is a simple Python console game where the user enters a number, and if the number is less than or equal to 100, the program will repeatedly double it until it exceeds 100. If the input is already greater than 100, the game informs the user that it cannot proceed.

## How to Play

1. Run the script.
2. Enter any integer.
3. If the number is 100 or less, the game will double it until it goes over 100.
4. If the number is greater than 100, the game will end, letting you know it’s already above the limit.

## Code Explanation

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Function Definition - `main()`**
   - The `main()` function contains all the logic for the game and is invoked only if the script is executed directly.

2. **Welcome Message**
   ```python
   print("Welcome to the 'Double the Number' game!")
   ```
   - This line prints a welcome message to introduce the game.

3. **User Input**
   ```python
   curr = int(input("Enter a number to start the game: "))
   ```
   - Prompts the user to enter a number, which is then converted to an integer. This is the starting number for the game.

4. **Game Logic**
   ```python
   if curr <= 100:
   ```
   - Checks if the entered number is less than or equal to 100. Only if this condition is true does the game proceed to the doubling phase.

5. **Doubling Loop**
   ```python
   while curr <= 100:
       curr *= 2
       print(f"Current number: {curr}")
   ```
   - A `while` loop is used to double the number until it exceeds 100.
   - After each doubling, the current number is printed to the console to show the progress.

6. **Ending Condition**
   ```python
   else:
       print("Sorry, we can only double numbers up to 100. Your number is already greater than 100.")
   ```
   - If the initial number is greater than 100, this message informs the user that the game can't proceed with numbers above this threshold.

7. **Script Execution Check**
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```
   - This line checks if the script is run directly (not imported). If true, it calls `main()` to start the game.

## Sample Output

```plaintext
Welcome to the 'Double the Number' game!
Enter a number to start the game: 25
Current number: 50
Current number: 100
Current number: 200
```
